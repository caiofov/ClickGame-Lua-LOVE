# Falling circles
## About the project
<p>A simple 2D game developed in Lua using LÃ–VE. The goal of its development is learning the basics of Lua programming language.</p>
<p>This project is based on this Challamade Youtube channel's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wttKHL90Ank">tutorial</a>, even though I have implemented original features for my game.</p>

## About the game

<p>You should click on the falling circles on the screen before loosing all your health.</p> 
<p>You will <b>loose health</b> by:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Clicking outside of the circles (black background)</li>
  <li> Letting a circle fall off the screen</li>
</ul>
<p>This game also saves the highest score, which is recorded on the file named <i>highest_score.txt</i></p>

### Updates?
<p>I don't have plans in upgrading this game, but I like to take notes regarding some improvements I could have develop. Here they are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Types of circles - each one with its own initial speed. The faster it is, more scores it gives to the player </li>
  <li> Pause option </li>
  <li> Countdown before starting/restarting the game </li>
  <li> Sound effects </li>
  <li> Nice graphics -> more attractive interface </li>
  <li> Record player's name when saving the highest score </li>
  <li> Instead of only one highest score, we could have a rank of top scores </li>
  <li> A few powerups would also fit nice. For example, an asset that could remove all the circles which are being displayed </li>
</ul>
